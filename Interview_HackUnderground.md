## Interview about the w2hack telegram public channel by the Hack Underground (Telegram community) (c), 2018

_Hey, dear friends! So, today's post is a bit unusual. Over many years of my work—speaking at various conferences, forums, and events dedicated to information security issues, teaching educational courses, lecturing at universities, maintaining a personal blog, and other activities, including our w2hack public channel, I have received a large number of questions, suggestions, ideas, constructive and not-so-constructive criticism, and comments, the answers to which, I hope, will be of interest to a wide audience.   All this is in my interview today!_

### Interview

**Editor:** Hello, everyone! Today we have Ivan, also known as [name hidden], author of the **w2hack** public page dedicated to information security, ethical hacking, and data protection issues.
V: Ivan, hello! Thank you for taking the time to talk to us. Well, let's get started right away!
O: Hello, everyone! Thank you for inviting me. I'm glad to be here and will try to answer all your questions. I'm ready, let's begin.

#### Q: Please tell us, what does the w2hack public channel mean to you?
A: I started running the public channel quite recently, with the first post published in March this year. However, the idea of creating a Telegram channel came to me much earlier.  I thought about it a lot and gathered materials. If it weren't for the constant lack of time and overload of projects, I would have started earlier. Nevertheless, even in such a short time, I tried to fill the public channel with materials that I hope are interesting to my audience.

In general, the public channel is a kind of platform for me where I can freely share interesting materials, practical lessons, links, advice and recommendations, experience from my practical activities, and everything that will be really useful for both novice specialists and already skilled seniors with my subscribers.

My public page is not a commercial project; I do not collect any money from subscribers and do not pay anyone to promote the channel. This is all my personal initiative. My goal is to teach, advise, and demonstrate case studies to a wide audience, with an emphasis on practical safety. I believe this is a very important aspect, since, in my opinion, the value lies in content that teaches something, after which the reader is left with practical skills and knowledge in their head, as opposed to, for example, most textbooks and articles that “just talk” about security.

#### Q: Why did you decide to launch your channel on Telegram?

A: Before launching my public channel on Telegram, I published most of my material on my personal blog and on the SecurityLab portal. My posts covered a wide range of topics, from compliance issues and technical aspects to personal data protection, Linux configuration, IT/IB audit features, etc. When I was teaching at the university, my students often asked me, “How do you do that?” and " Where do I configure this?“ and ”What can be done to solve this problem?“ So I decided that my public blog would contain only technical content, entirely focused on practical applications. In other words, not just phrases like ”to protect personal data, we need to encrypt the hard drive“ or ”one way to protect the system is to enforce a whitelist policy." Instead, it would be “which configuration file to edit,” “in which console tool to configure AppLocker,” “which commands to type in the terminal or CMD,” etc.

In addition, as I have seen for myself, universities are often unable to provide students with a high-quality education, and after graduation, to my great sorrow, many are unable to find suitable work in their field. There are several reasons for this (some of which I have already described in my article on the channel), but one of them is that the knowledge taught does not correspond to what is required of candidates in today's job market. This is because the “academic” teaching staff is qualitatively different from those who work in the industry, highly qualified specialists who could share their experience, there is also a minimum of quality information available for free (most useful literature is not published in Russia and is printed exclusively in English), some technological lag in the domestic IT industry compared to, for example, the US, and so on.

In part, this is also related to the time when I myself was studying at university. Back then, the internet was dial-up, phones still had flashlights, finding any information online was extremely difficult, torrents were just gaining momentum, there were almost no specialized websites, forums, or communities, and books and textbooks in electronic form were extremely rare. There was no talk of Telegram publics or blogs at all back then. That's why, from my student days until now, I've had to search for the information I need on my own, study new technologies and products, and master new tools (software, utilities), all through my own efforts. I know the value of knowledge and the effort it takes to acquire it!

That's why the public channel became a place where I could share materials and my experience in addition to what I gave to the guys in class. And, importantly, for people who live in other cities of our vast country and don't have the financial or physical resources to improve their knowledge in the field of information security.

However, I do not claim to be a guru or an authority. And I want to say right away to all the haters — just like anyone else, I can make mistakes or inaccuracies in some things. Everything I publish is my personal opinion, my own point of view, which may not coincide with yours. I am not obligated to anyone, and all material is distributed “as is.”

#### Q: What is your target audience?

A: (laughs) I don't tailor my content to any specific audience. Anyone who is interested in what I publish stays. One of the primary goals of creating the public page was to distribute materials for students, so I maintain a presentation style that progresses from simple to complex and try to focus on beginners or those who do not yet have much experience. Although, I am sure that some materials will be useful to advanced specialists who have been working for quite a long time or are involved in security in some other way. It is clear that fierce pen testers or bearded gurus with red eyes, beards, and sweaters will find it difficult to find anything new for themselves here. But otherwise, it covers a wide range of people, from those learning the basics and information security professionals to those who are simply interested in specific information security issues. As is often the case, for example, IT administrators and DevOps who are well versed in administration but are not very knowledgeable about how everything should be protected.

#### Q: Where do you get the material for your publications?

A: Hmm, interesting question! It's definitely hard to say. I've never kept any statistics on this. Most of my ideas come to me in my head, so I just come home, sit down, and write, recording my thoughts and adding various links, videos, and additional materials related to the topic of the article. Every day, I also browse a large number of aggregator sites that publish information security news, incidents, reports, and case studies. Many ideas also arise after solving a problem or completing a project in which I participated. Sometimes questions from subscribers or my students inspire me to write about certain topics. Some articles have been sitting in my drafts for a long time, waiting for me to format them and finalize them.

#### Q: Do you afraid that your materials could be used for illegal purposes?

A: You see, in my public page, I talk, share, demonstrate, but nothing more. How it might be used later is beyond my control. I can't go around holding everyone's hand and lecturing them, looking over their shoulders at their monitors and wagging my finger at them. It's the same as when you get your driver's license and get behind the wheel. If you have a brain, you'll obey the traffic rules.  Similarly, when you send your child to boxing class, where they teach them technique, how they will use it later — for self-defense or to bully their peers — depends more on their upbringing and moral qualities. I have published a disclaimer in which I clearly stated this. Besides, I don't just talk about “how to hack something” (laughs), but also how to protect yourself and your data. It's impossible to know how to defend yourself if you don't know how you might be attacked. A lot of the material in the public domain is devoted to configuring standard Windows and Linux security measures. And “attack techniques” are mainly related to the practice of conducting pen tests; there is no other way here. And it is not for nothing that the channel is called White 2 hack, that is, it clearly makes it clear which side we are on. (laughs)

Although I don't condemn those who have gone over to the dark side. That's reality. And here, everyone earns as much as they can. Don Corleone once said it very well: “It's just business, nothing personal.”

#### Q: What aspects of practical information security interest you personally?

A: Throughout my experience working in the information security industry, I've had to deal with almost everything—from managing information security services to setting up and administering information protection tools myself and conducting forensic procedures. That's why I consider myself a multidisciplinary specialist with a broad background. Of course, it is impossible to know everything about all areas of security equally well, and there are several areas where I have more expertise. But in my opinion, this approach is much better than narrow specialization, for example, only in the field of network protection, super-skills in SIEM administration, or skills in developing only information security documentation.  Yes, and in order to be able to build comprehensive corporate security as a CISO, you need to have a lot of knowledge in each subject area and have a thorough understanding of the situation. This is impossible without special knowledge and extensive experience. 

In general, of course, these are more technical aspects of information security—penetration testing, technical auditing of IT systems, configuring security options for standard protection tools and commercial security products (DLP, WAF, SIEM, IDS, etc.)—because it is this arsenal that essentially provides protection for the corporate perimeter. But I also pay a lot of attention to building the right information security processes in the company, because I have seen many times how a large number of information security systems and the money invested in them simply prove useless in the face of the “human factor.”

#### Q: What kind of feedback do you get most often?

A: Quite a variety. Most of it is questions about the materials I publish and requests for help in solving some non-standard issue. Sometimes people just write “thank you” or “very cool” to express their gratitude. Some people share links to articles and videos they have found, online courses, or simply their opinion on a particular issue. Rarely, but it does happen, people express dissatisfaction with the content, but as everywhere else, there will always be those who support you and those who oppose you. There have even been cases of insults or unfounded accusations in the comments. It's very difficult to talk to such people; they are bent on arguing, stirring up trouble in the comments, or simply lack normal human reasoning. But I hope that after this interview is published, there will be even more responses! (smiles)

#### Q: How do you feel about the fact that there are many other public pages on the topic of information security besides yours?

A: Do I have to feel anything in particular about it? (smiles) One of the points of the “hacker manifesto” states that “information should be free for everyone.” I am very happy that there are quite a few such channels today and that most of them are public. This is great because it allows for more information to be disseminated, content to be shared, and communities to be developed. I myself subscribe to several interesting public pages and enjoy reading their posts. I try to make my channel interesting, different from others, not repetitive, and share what I know and can do. Well, if readers find it interesting, they will become regular subscribers.

#### Q: What are your future plans or new ideas for your public page?

A: Definitely to continue promoting only high-quality and interesting content. I already have many ideas for new publications, but since preparing materials does not bring me any money and is more of a hobby, I unfortunately have very little time for this activity due to frequent project overload.  I also wanted to add hashtags to all published articles, but unfortunately, Telegram's standard functionality does not allow this. So I'm still thinking about this issue. 

And what would it be without surprises? (laughs) Very soon, I will be launching a series of open lectures called “Practical [Un]safety.” These are free open lectures for anyone interested in the most relevant topics in information security, compiled from numerous questions, suggestions, and ideas from the community I have created. The main focus of the lectures will be on “practical applicability,” that is, a minimum of theory and a maximum of demonstrations and practical recommendations. You can find all the details about the program, dates, and location in the posts on my resources.

#### Q: Ivan, would you like to say something to your subscribers?

A: Friends, thank you very much for staying with me on the w2hack channel. It's very nice to see our community growing. I would also like to express my gratitude to those who write, comment, send their ideas and thoughts, find inaccuracies, share their materials, and simply do not remain indifferent.  Feel free to write to w2hack@mail.ru or send me a private message @D3One. I look forward to your feedback!  Thanks to them, I can make the content more interesting and lively!

**Editor:** _Ivan, great conversation! Thank you very much for your candid answers! On behalf of ourselves and our numerous subscribers, we wish you creative success, new interesting challenges, and community growth!_
